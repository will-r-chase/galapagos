    <p>So, what does all of this mean for helping to predict earthquake risk? We’ve now seen that large earthquakes trigger hundreds to thousands of smaller earthquakes at great distances beyond the traditional aftershock zone. This finding is
      well accepted,
      though the significance of these small triggered quakes is unclear. It’s possible that these quakes can alter earthquake risk by either relieving or transferring stress in faults where they strike, but
      this is poorly understood and more research is needed. The more relevant finding is that the largest earthquakes can trigger other large earthquakes at remote distances. Importantly, we’ve seen that
      the triggered quakes are most likely to strike in the path of the mainshock seismic waves. Since the seismic waves converge at the antipode, this means that regions directly opposite a large mainshock should be
      on high alert for at least three days, after which the relative risk reduces. Particularly concerning, is that some studies have noted that remotely triggered quakes can occur in areas that are not considered fault zones, meaning
      they are less prepared and thus at higher risk of damage to property and to people.</p>

    <p>However, many scientist still question how common remote triggering of large earthquakes is, and the literature in this area
      remains in disagreement. It is crucial that we devote more research on the seismic mechanisms involved, so that we may better
      predict where and when risk of remotely triggered quakes is greatest. For example, why were so many large earthquakes triggered by the 2012 Sumatra earthquake? Was the strike-slip fracture mechanism a factor in that
      case? Some have also noted periods of quiesence before and/or after large mainshocks, arguing that the stress buildup and release—like an elastic band—may be important in predicting remote triggering—a question that deserves further
      attention. Ultimately more research is needed to determine
      the details, exact risk, and likelihood of these events, but given the evidence so far, next time I see a big earthquake in the news, I’ll be on the lookout to see if it’s on the other side of the world as me—something that once may have
      been reassuring, now concerning.
